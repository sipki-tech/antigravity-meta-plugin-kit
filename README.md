# antigravity-meta-plugin-kit — Google Antigravity plugin development toolkit

**Scaffold, lint, and ship [Google Antigravity](https://antigravity.google)
plugins without rediscovering the loader's undocumented traps.** A
zero-dependency Node.js toolkit: a plugin generator, a trap-aware linter, a
set of portable Agent Skills, and bilingual guides for every part of the
Antigravity customization system — plugins, skills (SKILL.md), hooks
(hooks.json), rules, workflows, subagents, and MCP servers.

## Why this exists

The Antigravity plugin loader has failure modes that are **silent**: a plugin
without `installed_version.json` is ignored without a word; a string `author`
trips validation; a throwing hook breaks the user's whole session; a skill
whose description lacks a trigger phrase simply never fires. Some contracts
are documented only inside the CLI binary's built-in docs; others exist only
as field observations.

This kit turns that knowledge into executable form:

- **`create`** — generates a native-only plugin repository that is correct by
  construction: manifest, root `hooks.json` with a fail-open guard, a SKILL.md
  that routes, tests that pass out of the box, CI. No bundled installer — the
  result installs with `agy plugin install`.
- **`lint`** — validates any plugin payload against every known trap, with
  named checks and warnings.
- **Skills + guides** — teach an AI agent (or a human) the whole system, with
  provenance for every claim ([docs/internals.md](docs/internals.md)).

`create` and `lint` ship as `scripts/` inside the plugin, so they work after
`agy plugin install`; from a checkout, run them directly with
`node plugins/antigravity-meta-plugin-kit/scripts/{create,lint}.mjs`.

## Install as a plugin

The meta-kit is itself an Antigravity plugin. Install it straight from GitHub
with the Antigravity CLI — the six meta skills, four authoring subagents, and
the `/meta-*` slash commands land in your sessions (restart Antigravity
afterwards):

```bash
# clones the repo, registers the plugin, tracks it in agy plugin list
agy plugin install https://github.com/sipki-tech/antigravity-meta-plugin-kit

# manage it natively
agy plugin list
agy plugin disable antigravity-meta-plugin-kit
agy plugin uninstall antigravity-meta-plugin-kit

# update = re-run install (it re-clones the latest main)
agy plugin install https://github.com/sipki-tech/antigravity-meta-plugin-kit
```

`agy plugin install` is **global** — it installs into `~/.gemini/` for every
workspace. To scope the plugin to a single project instead, **vendor** it:
copy the payload into `<project>/.agents/plugins/antigravity-meta-plugin-kit/`
and commit it. There is no per-project *install command* — Antigravity's
workspace discovery loads whatever lives under a project's `.agents/`
(verified: both `.agents/plugins/<name>/` and a flat `.agents/skills/<name>/`
are picked up). See the [manifest guide](docs/guides/plugin-manifest.md).

## Quick start

The `create` and `lint` tools live in the plugin's `scripts/`. From a checkout
of this repo:

```bash
S=plugins/antigravity-meta-plugin-kit/scripts

# scaffold a new native-only plugin repository into ./my-plugin/
node "$S/create.mjs" my-plugin

# preview without writing anything
node "$S/create.mjs" my-plugin --dry-run

# also scaffold an example subagent (agents/*.md — undocumented format)
node "$S/create.mjs" my-plugin --with-agents

# validate an existing plugin (payload dir or scaffolded repo root)
node "$S/lint.mjs" my-plugin
```

Then, inside the scaffold:

```bash
cd my-plugin
npm test                                   # green out of the box
agy plugin validate plugins/my-plugin      # official structural validator
agy plugin install plugins/my-plugin       # install the local payload; agy plugin list to confirm
```

The bundled subagents (format: 4× markdown — validated):

| Subagent | Rights | Job |
|---|---|---|
| `meta-payload-auditor` | read-only | semantic payload review beyond mechanical lint: trigger quality, hook-script logic, manifest coherence |
| `meta-hook-smith` | read-only | designs hooks: picks the event, produces the hooks.json block, a fail-open script, and tests |
| `meta-trap-scout` | terminal (read-effect) | detects drift between the installed Antigravity and the documented contracts |
| `meta-doc-mirror` | writes `*.ru.md` only | keeps bilingual docs in lockstep, section for section |

Workflow wrappers give them deterministic entry points: `/meta-audit`,
`/meta-hook`, `/meta-scout`, `/meta-mirror` (agents don't auto-surface as
slash commands — see the [subagents guide](docs/guides/agents.md)).

## What `create` generates

```
my-plugin/
├── plugins/my-plugin/          # the plugin payload
│   ├── plugin.json             # object author, interface block, all fields
│   ├── hooks.json              # at the ROOT (official location); named hooks;
│   │                           # example fail-open PreToolUse guard
│   ├── scripts/example-guard.mjs + scripts/lib/io.mjs  # runHook() fail-open wrapper,
│   │                           # official decision dialect (+legacy compat)
│   ├── skills/my-plugin-example/SKILL.md   # frontmatter + trigger phrase
│   │   └── resources/prompt-template.md    # XML-sectioned prompt template
│   ├── agents/                 # only with --with-agents (example subagent)
│   ├── rules/style.md
│   └── mcp_config.json
├── test/                       # unit + e2e (node --test), green out of the box
├── README.md                   # install via `agy plugin install https://github.com/…`
└── .github/workflows/ci.yml    # npm test + `agy plugin validate` (when agy is present)
```

Native-only by construction: no `bin/` CLI and no `installer/` — the payload
is installed with `agy plugin install`, which clones, registers, and updates
it.

## Lint checks

Exit 1 on any FAIL; warnings and notes never affect the exit code.

| Check | Trap it covers |
|---|---|
| plugin.json exists / parses / name matches dir | basic manifest integrity |
| author is an object | string author trips validation |
| version is semver, interface declared | plugin-manager display |
| declared paths exist (skills/rules/hooks) | dangling manifest refs |
| every skill has SKILL.md; frontmatter valid | skills that never load |
| skill descriptions carry a trigger | skills that never route |
| hooks.json parses / declares named hooks | event name at top level (Claude Code-style config never loads) |
| hook entries well-formed (6 events, both shapes, type=command) | malformed handlers |
| hook timeouts sane | non-numeric/negative timeouts |
| hook scripts exist / fail-open | session-breaking hooks |
| agents/* minimally valid (toml + md) | broken subagent definitions |
| mcp: non-builtin commands ship disabled | missing binary breaks sessions |
| workflows have description frontmatter | broken /slash-commands |
| rules non-empty | dead manifest ref |

Warnings (never affect the exit code): hooks.json not at the plugin root
(`agy plugin validate` won't see it), duplicated hooks.json with drift,
missing/oversized timeouts (official default is 30s of blocking), unknown
hook events, `${PLUGIN_ROOT}` in hook commands (expands to an empty string
on CLI 1.1.1 — use `node ./scripts/x.mjs`), skill-name style, a committed
`installed_version.json`.

The fail-open check is a heuristic (a `runHook(` wrapper or a try/catch
around the body) — it catches the common miss, not every unsafe script.
A committed `installed_version.json` warns: it is an install-time artifact,
never a payload file — the IDE plugin-manager writes it, while `agy plugin
install` tracks the plugin in `import_manifest.json` instead (see
[internals](docs/internals.md)).

## Skills

Six portable Agent Skills under
[plugins/antigravity-meta-plugin-kit/skills/](plugins/antigravity-meta-plugin-kit/skills/):
`meta-scaffold`, `meta-hooks`, `meta-skills`, `meta-agents`, `meta-test`,
`meta-ship`. The
[plugin install](#install-as-a-plugin) delivers them into Antigravity; for
other hosts, copy a skill directory into `~/.claude/skills/` (Claude Code)
or `~/.codex/skills/` (Codex).

## The trap registry

[docs/internals.md](docs/internals.md) is the canonical record of every
loader trap, hook wire format, and component convention — each claim tagged
`[OFFICIAL 2026-07]`, `[OBSERVED 2026-07]`, or `[MEDIUM]`, with a
"Refuted rumors" section that dates its own reversals (`SessionStart`:
refuted on 1.0.16, confirmed live on 1.1.1 with its wire contract
recorded). The linter
implements it; the skills and guides reference it.

## Relationship to `agy plugin validate`

Antigravity ships its own structural validator. Run **both**:

| | `agy plugin validate` | this kit's `lint` |
|---|---|---|
| skills / agents / commands / mcpServers structure | ✔ | partially |
| root hooks.json presence | ✔ | ✔ (+ content, timeouts, fail-open) |
| manifest style (author object, interface, semver) | — | ✔ |
| rules/ and workflows/ | — | ✔ |
| trigger-phrase routing, skill style | — | ✔ |
| installed_version.json trap | — | ✔ (warn/note) |

## Relationship to antigravity-kit

[antigravity-kit](https://github.com/sipki-tech/antigravity-kit) is the
reference implementation every pattern here was extracted from — and the
first consumer of this linter: CI clones it and lints its payload on every
push (the dogfood gate).

## FAQ

**Does this work with the Antigravity IDE, the CLI (`agy`), or both?**
The payloads it produces satisfy **both** worlds' formats — the rich IDE
plugin-manager manifest and the CLI customization-root layout (root
`hooks.json`, minimal manifest). The commands shown here install through the
CLI (`agy plugin install`), which writes to `~/.gemini/config/plugins/`. See
the [manifest guide](docs/guides/plugin-manifest.md).

**Why zero dependencies?** The tools and hooks run on other people's machines
inside Antigravity; every dependency is attack surface and install friction.
Node ≥18 built-ins (which Antigravity ships) cover everything needed.

**Why did my plugin install but never load?** If you hand-copied it into
`~/.gemini/config/plugins/`, the IDE plugin-manager needs an
`installed_version.json` it never got — install through `agy plugin install`
instead, which registers the plugin for you. See
[the manifest guide](docs/guides/plugin-manifest.md).

**Can hooks be written in something other than Node?** Yes — any executable
(`sh -c` runs it). The fail-open law still applies: exit 0 and valid JSON on
every path. The scaffolded `io.mjs` just makes that easy in Node.

## Development

```bash
npm test          # node --test; includes the dogfood suite when
                  # ../antigravity-kit is checked out (or AGY_KIT_PAYLOAD is set)
                  # and the agy-validate suite when `agy` is on PATH
```
